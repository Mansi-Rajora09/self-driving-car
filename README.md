# self-driving-car
Welcome to my self-driving car project built entirely using JavaScript, with a sprinkle of HTML and CSS for the interface. This repository houses the codebase for a fascinating journey into the world of autonomous vehicles, where we've leveraged machine learning techniques to train a neural network to drive.
